This is a common structure that is used in many React Native projects. You can adjust it to fit your specific needs and add or remove folders as necessary.

The assets folder is used to store images, fonts, and other static assets that are used in the app.
The components folder contains reusable UI components, such as buttons, cards, and form fields, that are used throughout the app.
The contexts folder is used to store contexts for global state management, such as user authentication and data storage.
The hooks folder contains custom hooks, which are reusable functions that can be used to manage state, side effects, and other aspects of your app.
The navigation folder is used to store navigation-related components and logic, such as the stack navigator and tab navigator.
The screens folder contains top-level screens, which are the main pages of the app, and are used to organize the navigation flow.
The services folder contains networking, storage, and other service-related code, such as API clients and database access code.
The utils folder is used to store utility functions and modules, such as helper functions and utility classes.
The App.tsx file is the root component of the app and is used to initialize and render the app.
This structure makes it easy to organize and manage the code for your app and ensures that the code is modular and maintainable.
